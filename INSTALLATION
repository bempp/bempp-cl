The following packages are recommended to run bempp-cl

numpy, scipy, numba, pytest, pyopencl, meshio, plotly, jupyter.

The easiest installation is through conda. The bempp directory contains
a file environment.yaml. Simply run

>> conda env create -f environment.yml

and a complete conda environment called bempp is setup. Once it is created
change into the environment with 

>> conda activate bempp

You can now install the bempp-cl package with

>> pip install git+git://github.com/bempp/bempp-cl.git

By default bempp-cl uses the pocl (portablecl.org) OpenCL CPU library.
Other OpenCL capable devices can be used if a corresponding ICD file is
available. These need to be copied into the 
~/.conda/envs/bempp/conda/etc/OpenCL/vendors directory.
