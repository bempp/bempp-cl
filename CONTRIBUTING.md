# How to contribute

## Reporting bugs
If you find a bug in Bempp-cl, please report it on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bempp/bempp-cl/issues)
and tag it "bug". If you are unsure if what you have found is a bug, or want to ask a more general question,
you can do this on the [Bempp discourse forum](https://bempp.discourse.group/).

## Suggesting enhancements
If you want to suggest a new feature or an improvement of a current feature, you can submit this
on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/bempp/bempp-cl/issues) and tag it "enhancement".

## Submitting a pull request
If you want to directly submit code to Bempp-cl, you can do this by forking the Bempp-cl repo, then submitting a pull request.
If you want to contribute, but are unsure where to start, have a look at the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/bempp/bempp-cl/issues) for issues labelled "good first issue".

On opening a pull request, unit tests and flake8 style checks will run. You can click on these in the pull request
to see where (if anywhere) there are errors in your code.

If you plan to work on a large feature, it would be sensible to suggest it on the issue tracker or Discource first so we
can confirm that is a feature we would like before you spend too long working on it.

## Code of conduct
We expect all our contributors to follow [the Contributor Covenant](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Any unacceptable
behaviour can be reported to Matthew (bempp@mscroggs.co.uk) or Timo (tbetcke@ucl.ac.uk).
